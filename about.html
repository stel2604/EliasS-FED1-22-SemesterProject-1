            <h1>About MAMO</h1>     
            <p>Mamo is a unique combination of museums. MUST is one of the few museums in Norway that covers such varied subject areas as nature, 
                culture and art history, as well as shipping and industry.

                Norway's only preserved medieval monastery Utstein Kloster is also part of Mamo and this museum is located on Moster√∏y, approx. 
                30 minutes' drive from Stavanger. <br>
                
                <br>Mamo is located in Hillevag and the Revtangen ornithological station is located in Revtangen.
                 They can be visited on open days and by appointment. <br>
                
                <br>Mamo manages 127,000 art, cultural and natural history objects and 64,000 photographs. 
                A selection of these can be experienced in exciting exhibitions and events in Mamo's eleven museums. 
                Several of these are located in culturally historic buildings and parks. <br>
                
                <br>During the year, the museums offer over 400 events. Every autumn, Museumsnatt is organized in collaboration with the Archaeological Museum.
                
                Mamo emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative communication. 
                Several of the museum's communication projects have won national awards.
                The museum is one of five regional museums in Rogaland. <br>

                <br>The museum is organized into four specialist departments and a department for community services, 
                which is owned by Stavanger municipality (53%) and Rogaland county municipality (47%).
                
                Mamo believes that diversity is a strength. Mamo's museums are open to all people and we do not accept racism or discrimination of any kind. It is the museum's responsibility to work for greater diversity both in operations, in our collections and otherwise in the stories we tell.
